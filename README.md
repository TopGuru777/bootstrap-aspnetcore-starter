# ASP.NET Core Bootstrap starting project

We happy to [announce](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2017/09/26/new-bootstrap-controls-for-asp-net-core-2-0-alpha-release-will-you-help-us-test-them-please.aspx) our new set of controls for the new ASP.NET Core 2.0 framework. The new controls are based on the existing Bootstrap controls in terms of features and API, but they are written specifically for the ASP.NET Core framework (v2.0).

This project demonstrates how to use these controls in an ASP.NET Core application. You can use this project as a starter for your next ASP.NET Core project. All required DevExpress references are already included. There's also [a docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/devexpress/bootstrap-aspnetcore-starter) that contains this demo project running on Ubuntu!


## Getting Started

After you download this project, open it in Visual Studio 2017. All the required NuGet packages will be automatically downloaded once project building is started.

## Online demos
